# Heart-Stroke-Prediction-using-R
This project is a predictive model to predict if a patient or a person will suffer from a heart stroke from the available parameters collected. This predictive model considers **Stroke** incidence as **dependant variable** and the other parameters like age, gender, work type, residence type and so on as **independant variables**.

##### Data Set:
We have used a data set with captures some parameters like smoking status; work type; pre-existing conditions like hypertension, heart diseases, glucose level; personal details like gender, age, marital status and so on.

##### Process:
###### Data Cleansing
###### Data Manipulation
###### Data Model
###### Visualization
###### Analysis

##### Independant Variables:
* Gender 
* Age
* Hypertension
* Heart Disease
* Ever Married
* Work Type
* Residence Type
* Average Glucose Level
* BMI
* Smoking Status

##### Dependant Variables:
* Stroke

##### Libraries:
* Dplyr 
* corrplot
* ggplot 
* randomForest 

##### Use Cases:
* Doctors to prescribe the best treatment for a patient who is expected to have an incidence of Heart Stroke
* Health Insurance Companies to quote coverage fee for a certain illness or pre-existing condition.
* Life Insurance companies can factor in the pre-existing conditions and the outcome of this model to calculate their premium fee.

##### Scope of Extension:
* The data collection at the source could collect more parameters like the stress level or number of working hours, dietary restrictions and calorie intake and so on to improve on the quality of data to enable a better prediction
* The model can be improved by taking into account the significance of each and every independant variable on the outcome
